## What is convered in this code and tutorial?

You'll create two functions: deleteExternalEmptyRowsNColumns() and deleteInternalEmptyRowsNColumns(). The first function will delete empty rows and columns from the range that are outside of the range returned by the method getDataRange(). The second function will delete the rows and columns that are empty which are inside of the range returned by getDataRange(). We will also create a menu so that we can execute these functions from the spreadsheet itself.
